desc = "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a space telescope for NASA's Explorers program, designed to search for exoplanets using the transit method in an area 400 times larger than that covered by the Kepler mission.[6] It was launched on April 18, 2018, atop a Falcon 9 rocket and was placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. The first light image from TESS was taken on August 7, 2018, and released publicly on September 17, 2018. Over the course of the two-year primary mission, TESS is expected to ultimately detect about 1250 transiting exoplanets orbiting the targeted stars, and an additional 13,000 transiting planets orbiting additional stars in the fields that TESS observed.";
