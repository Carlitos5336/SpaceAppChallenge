name = "Kepler";

desc = "The Kepler space telescope was part of NASA's Discovery Program of relatively low-cost science missions. The telescope's construction and initial operation were managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with Ball Aerospace responsible for developing the Kepler flight system. Kepler observed 530,506 stars and discovered 2,662 exoplanets over its lifetime. After nine years of operation, the telescope's reaction control system fuel was depleted, and NASA announced its retirement on October 30, 2018. So donâ€™t try to fix it...it will die eventually. Oops hahah, I guess I told you late.";
